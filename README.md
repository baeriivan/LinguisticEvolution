# ADA Project - Linguistic Evolution

Le Temps corpus document indirectly the evolution of written language between
1800 and 2000. Is the linguistic evolution stable or does it changes faster? There
is more and more quantitative studies about semantic change, the purpose of this
project is to use a new approach, a Bayesian model, in order to answer to this
question.
