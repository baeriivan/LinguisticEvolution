# ADA Project - Linguistic Evolution

## Abstract
Le Temps corpus document indirectly the evolution of written language between
1800 and 2000. Is the linguistic evolution stable or does it changes faster? There
is more and more quantitative studies about semantic change, the purpose of this
project is to use a new approach, a Bayesian model, in order to answer to this
question [from projects presentation].

## Data description
The data, a corpus of archive of the newspaper "Le Temps" between 1800 and 2000, is
provided by the EPFL. It is said to have a size of approx. 20GB.

## Feasibility and Risks
The risks are rather low as the data set is given by the EPFL, it can be expected to get
raw data of decent quality. Moreover a talk with an external supervisor (EPFL) could help us 
going in the right track. As other approaches have already been tried, we can be confident 
about the feasibility of this project. One risk remaining would be the lack of time to implement
the Bayesian model from scratch, if no library has it already.

## Deliverables
- A python notebook explaining how the data was wrangled and cleaned.
- A cleaned data set.
- A python notebook presenting our work in deeper details with choices made (long version).
- A python notebook presenting our results (short version) - what can be concluded with the linguistic evolution.
- Eventual python files created for the projects.

## Timeplan
- 06.11 - Deliver proposal
- 13.11 - Get the data, eventually talk with an external supervisor (?)
- 20.11 - Prepare infrastructure: Determine what tools will be used, learn how they work (Bayesian model in ref.), prepare access to server? (to be determined)
- 27.11 - Data wrangling/cleaning
- 04.12 - Implementation of the Bayesian model
- 11.12 - Check-point (approx. date) [security week, to catch up if needed]
