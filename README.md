# ADA Project - Linguistic Evolution

## Abstract
Le Temps corpus document indirectly the evolution of written language between
1800 and 2000. Is the linguistic evolution stable or does it changes faster? There
is more and more quantitative studies about semantic change, the purpose of this
project is to use a Skip-grams with Negative Sampling (SGNS) model to answer this
question .

## Data description
The data, a corpus of archive of the newspaper "Le Temps" between 1800 and 2000, is
provided by the EPFL. It has a size of approx. 20GB.

## Deliverables
- A python notebook explaining how the data was wrangled and cleaned.
- A cleaned data set (no data is available in github).
- A python notebook presenting our work in deeper details with choices made (long version).
- A python notebook presenting our results (short version) - what can be concluded with the linguistic evolution.
- Eventual python files created for the projects.
- A poster
